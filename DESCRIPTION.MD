# Front-end challenge project description

I have to say, I was really excited to work on this project because I got the chance to show you my skills, but also because I decided to learn something new and play around with it. I am talking about the [NGXS](https://www.ngxs.io/) library, the [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) library (was using it before, but I managed to learn quite a few more operators and best practices) and the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) testing framework. The reason I chose [Angular](https://angular.io/) is because I am most familiar with and also to finish this project in the shortest amount of time.

From another point of view, the project is not perfect, I was not even trying to achieve that, but certain parts like the pagination functionality are not very scalable and were made like this for this specific project, of course on a larger scale, a different approach would be necessary.

In terms of testing, I did implement some unit tests for my state and actions which can be run with `ng test`

## How long did it take?

Approximately two weeks. I can see that today(24-03-2020) there are 13 days since my first commit. Today I have officially finished the implementation, the tests and the build are both passing. I would like to mention that I also have a full time job and I was putting the most hours during the weekend, so I had 4 days of full-time work and I would say these last 2 days as well since my tasks for work are mostly done. During last week and the week before (Wed-Fri) I worked maybe a few hours almost every evening.

## Which part was the hardest to implement?

Well considering that I decided to learn NGXS (state management) I would say implementing this was the hardest, but to be honest, it actually seemed easier after I was done because it greatly simplified most of my components and it makes perfect sense. I initially did everything in just a few days but without state management and after that I decided to upgrade which essentially changed the whole application.

## What functionalities am I most proud of ?

I would say first place is the NGXS functionality as I just learnt it am very excited about its power, followed by the filtering and then the responsive design I managed to make. The filtering is quite cool because itâ€™s dynamic and will always get all the years and all the currencies that might be added to the database.
